    "name": "Core Aeration",
    "description" : "In simplest terms, Core Aeration is the process of making finger sized holes in your lawn and depositing the removed material on the surface to break down. This allows fertilizer, water and oxygen to get to the roots where healthy grass originates. Small plugs of soil and thatch are removed allowing more air, water and nutrients to reach the root zone, leading to better plant growth. The microorganisms in the plugs that remain on the surface will dissolve back into the thatch layer to help it breakdown, naturally."
